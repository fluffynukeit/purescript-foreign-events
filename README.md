# purescript-foreign-events
Purescript library defining simple, unopinionated types for the event object
hierarchy.  Nothing more.

The types provided in this library can be used as a starting point to build
more sophisticated, opinionated functionality, like newtypes/type classes, 
callback wrappers, etc.
